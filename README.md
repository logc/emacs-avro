# emacs-avro

Emacs mode for AVDL

This is the same code found on [the repository this code was forked
from](https://github.com/nealsid/emacs-avro), but including [some updates by
another author](https://github.com/nealsid/emacs-avro/pull/2) that never made it
into the mainline.

Time permitting, I would like to expand this mode to include:

- [ ] dealing with `avsc` files

## Installation

This package is not in any package repository, so you need to put it somewhere
in your Emacs' path, and then `require` it in your `.emacs` configuration.
